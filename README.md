# YouTube Web Crawler

This Python script allows you to crawl the Google search results and collect YouTube links based on a given query. It uses web scraping techniques to extract the desired information.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Requests library
- BeautifulSoup library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

## Usage

Open the youtube_crawler.py file.
Modify the query variable to specify your desired search query. For example, if you want to search for YouTube links related to a specific website, you can enter the site URL or domain.
Adjust the max_results variable to determine the maximum number of YouTube links to scrape. Please note that scraping a large number of results may take some time.
Save the file and run it using the command:


python youtube_crawler.py

The script will start scraping the Google search results and collect the YouTube links. Once the process is complete, the results will be saved in a file named youtube_links.json.

The script outputs the results in JSON format. The structure of the JSON file will be as follows:

{
    "youtube_links": [
        "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxxxxxxx",
        "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyyyyyyyyy",
        ...
    ]
}

If no YouTube links are found for the given query, the output will be:


{
    "youtube_links": []
}


Note
Web scraping should be done responsibly and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the websites you are scraping. Be mindful of the volume of requests you send and the impact it may have on the target website. Consider adding delays between requests and ensure that you are not violating any legal or ethical boundaries.

Please use this script responsibly and respect the website's policies.
